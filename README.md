### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Kinnaird (he/him). I'm the CTO of a [stealth startup](https://twitter.com/kmcquade3/status/1555271839890386944?s=20&t=AYGsgXMUTVujP8-asOWHcw) in the security industry. Previously, I worked as a Staff Security Engineer at Square on [the Cloud Security team](https://twitter.com/JerinSaji0/status/1486107421055410178?s=20&t=AYGsgXMUTVujP8-asOWHcw), a Lead Security Engineer at Salesforce, and Cloud Security Consulting Practice Lead at Synopsys.
